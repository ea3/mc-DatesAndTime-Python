# Create a program that allows  a user to choose one of
# up to 9 time zones from a menu. You can choose any
# zones you want from the all_timezones lists.

# The program will then display the time in that time zone as
# well as local time and UTC time.
# Entering 0 as the choice will quit the program

# Display the dates and times in a format suitable for the
